# eloquent-js-3rd-ed-exercises

My solutions for the exercises in the 3rd edition of [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/). They all work but are generally first attempts that are good enough, so don't expect too much code wizardry.

To run all the exercises at once, run the following command in the source folder:

    $ node index.js
